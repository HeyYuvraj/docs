## Introduction

Here at ZAP-Hosting, we believe in the power of our Community, thus we are pleased to run our very own ZAP-Hosting Community Contributions program. This program enables our ZAP Community to produce high-quality, practical and easily accessible guides to support a wide range of topics and help out other fellow people. The program also supports creativity and cohesiveness from our Community through the creation of unique Blog content and quality assurance of the translations on our website.

All content produced under this program provides rewards in the form of ZAP Coins or a monetary payout to the author via PayPal as an awesome benefit! You can view what criteria we use for reward payouts and how much we reward within the dedicated page of the chosen contribution category that are explored in the next sub-section.

Our program currently accepts contributions in **English**, excluding Translation which does not follow this.

In order to comply with copyright laws, we cannot accept content from other sources. All content that is produced under our contribution program **must be original work** produced by you.

## What qualifies for this program?

We are pleased to have expanded our program to cover new areas in response to great engagement and feedback from the Community. These areas of interest are briefly presented below alongside a link to their dedicated guide page where you can view further information.

### ZAP Docs - Creating & Updating guides

Our existing area of interest is for content creation of guides on our official [ZAP-Hosting Docs](https://zap-hosting.com/guides/). This involves creating brand new guides but also covers updates and expansions to exisiting guides where deemed necessary.

We are pleased to introduce blog posts as our latest area of interest for our contribution program. This is a very exciting opportunity which involves writing your very own informative blog posts for our official [ZAP-Hosting.com Blog](https://zap-hosting.com/en/blog/).

## Who is this program for? - UPDATE THIS SECTION

The contribution program is accessible to anyone who wants to share their knowledge and experience with the community! We actively look for dedicated writers who have strong technical skills and are knowledgeable in the respective field. Most importantly, we look for writers who are dedicated and are happy in collaborating with our ZAP-Hosting docs team to improve and revise their content prior to publishing.

Are you interested in joining the conversation and collaborating with other like-minded people? Feel free to join our [Discord Server](https://discord.com/invite/zaphosting) and use the **#Customise Community** channel to assign yourself the contribution role to keep updated with the latest changes, communicate with other contributors and to collaborate!

## Provision of Temporary Services

On demand and apparent necessity do we provide the services that are needed to create a guide or blog for a limited period of time. This way we want to provide the possibility to create guides about topics even for those who don't have an active service for this at the moment. The request for a service can be made during the submission process. 

The provisioning depends on a few factors. For example, the activity of your ZAP-Hosting account is evaluated, how active you have already been in terms of contribution program, and whether provisioning by us is absolutely necessary for the planned content. 

If a service is provided, it will be made available to you free of charge for a limited period of time. The provision is limited to a few days depending on the scope of the content and the required service.
